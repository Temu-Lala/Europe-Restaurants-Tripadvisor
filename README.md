## About the dataset we used

The website is well known for displaying user ratings and reviews for restaurants, hotels, b&b, touristic attractions, and other places, with a total word count of all reviews is more than 10 billion.

## ETL Process
This project Practiced Python's Pandas library to extract, transform, and load the data into a PostgreSQL database.
  ### Visualization
  Power BI is used to visualize the meaningful insights by connecting to PostgreSQL database.
 ### Visualization list 
 - Count of poor, Count of terrible, Count of very_good, Count of total_reviews_count and Count of
excellent

- Count of avg_rating by country

- Count of features by restaurant_name

- Count of cuisines by country
